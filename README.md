# 🧮 iOS Calculator App

My first iOS application built with SwiftUI and MVVM architecture.

## 📱 About This Project

As an Android developer transitioning to iOS, this is my first step into the Apple ecosystem. Coming from Kotlin and Android development, I'm excited to explore SwiftUI and learn iOS development patterns.

This calculator app represents my journey from Android to iOS development, implementing clean architecture principles I'm familiar with from Android in the Swift/iOS world.


## 🏗️ Architecture

Built using **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern:
- **Model**: `CalculatorButton`, `CalculatorOperation`
- **ViewModel**: `CalculatorViewModel` (Business logic)
- **View**: `ContentView`, `DisplayView`, `CalculatorButtonView` (UI)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Architecture**: MVVM
- **Design**: iOS Native Calculator inspired
